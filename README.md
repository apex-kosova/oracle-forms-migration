# oracle-forms-migration
Oracle PL/SQL scripts and Oracle APEX application, both aimed at migrating from Oracle Forms to other interfaces - only migrations to Oracle APEX are available at this moment; other languages can be covered later.

- Create a separated database user with privilege to create directory
- Upload your Oracle Forms object list report text file to the directory
- Your text file must be UTF-8 format
- Run these scripts in the correct sequence to create database objects
- Latest file named "migracao_data_batch.sql" should read and process your text files
